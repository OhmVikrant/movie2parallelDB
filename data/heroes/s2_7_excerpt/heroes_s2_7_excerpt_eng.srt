1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,609
Plane ticket, painting,
it all points to Montreal.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,775
What is this place?

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,818
"We were right about the Company.
The world is in danger. Adam. "

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,256
Please, tell me who I am.
What the future holds.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,974
We’ll figure it out.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,572
-We’re in New York.
-Where is everyone?

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,815
It’s an evacuation order.

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,254
June 14th, 2008.

9
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,608
This is next year.

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,772
This thing we could do,
it only begins at reading minds...

11
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:26,089
and then it becomes so much more.

12
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:28,455
My dad can put a thought
into anyone’s head.

13
00:00:30,538 --> 00:00:32,449
Now we know why Molly calls him
the nightmare man.

14
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:34,810
-It’s Bob.
-He runs the Company.

15
00:00:34,938 --> 00:00:37,611
-Looks like he’s next.
-You sure you’ll be able to cure me?

16
00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:41,133
In exchange, we’re going to want
a little something from you.

17
00:00:41,257 --> 00:00:42,929
-Hello, Dr. Suresh.
-So you’re...

18
00:00:43,016 --> 00:00:44,006
Your new partner.

19
00:00:46,096 --> 00:00:47,086
Claire?

20
00:00:47,376 --> 00:00:48,524
Oh my god!

21
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:50,965
-Did you see her face?
-Somebody could have seen us!

22
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:53,888
Relax! Just think of it
as a lesson in humility.

23
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,730
-What’s on your neck?
-Last thing I remember is...

24
00:00:56,815 --> 00:00:59,091
this man stepping out
of the bushes calling my name.

25
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:00,574
What are you talking about?
What man?
